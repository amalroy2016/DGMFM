This work is a personal project to try and learn the effectiveness of Neural Networks for being used as a method of solving fuild simulation problems.
The Article written on this project was rejected with valuable comments from the journal Computers and Fluids.

Major revisions are being done and the method is in fact similar to what is being developed in universities as the Physics Informed Neural Networks, thought I did not try the data-driven learning part.

See Paper.pdf in the repository for the submitted whitepaper.

An attempt is also made towards the application to wave equations.
